# Abstract

Forecasting temperature by the use of advance statistical tools is very
important in understanding and dealing with the effects of rising or
decreasing temperatures. This study uses Time series analysis and
predictions, a statistical methods to analyze and forecast temperatures,
by using the average max, min and mean temperature for each month of
different regions in the United Kingdom measured by the Met Office. The
increase in concerns about the effects of rising or decreasing
temperature on humans, animals, the climate, oceans, and seasonal
patterns provokes the need for accurate models for forecasting the
temperatures of the different regions across the globe. This report
presents the results of forecasting temperatures using trend analysis,
seasonality estimation through seasonal averages and seasonal harmonics,
the final model were selected using the autoregressive integrated moving
average models

# 1. DATA COLLECTION

The data used for this study was gotten from the Met Office website
where we sourced for the average max, min and mean temperature for each
month for 10 different districts in the UK. This gave us 30 different
time series to work with, In order to collect the data from this website
without having to download all the individual files or read in the files
individually, a function was created, which takes two arguments; the
region(district) and the temperature(parameter), For each desired time
series data, the function reads in the data, transform it using the time
series function and outputs a time series data from 1884 to 2020 at a
frequency of 12 observations per year which reperesents each individual
monthly average in a year. The time series data was saved in a nested
lists for each of the different parameters which made the it easy to
work with the massive count of this data.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
#We created a function that takes region and district and imports the data from the Metoffice website.
# Create a list of all regions
districts <- c("Northern_Ireland",

               "Scotland_N",

               "Scotland_E",

               "Scotland_W",

               "England_E_and_NE",

               "England_NW_and_N_Wales",

               "Midlands",

               "East_Anglia",

               "England_SW_and_S_Wales",

               "England_SE_and_Central_S"

)

 
# create a list of all Parameters
features <- c("Tmin", "Tmean", "Tmax")

 
# indicate template of the url
address <-"https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/pub/data/weather/uk/climate/datasets/"

 
# Create a function that reads in files from the website
read.ts <- function(district, feature){

  c(address, feature, "/date/", district, ".txt") %>%

  paste(collapse = "") %>%

  read.table(header = TRUE, skip = 5, nrow = 137) %>%

  subset(select = 2:13) %>%

  t() %>%

  as.vector() %>%

  ts(frequency = 12, end = c(2020, 12))

}

```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# Function to apply the read.ts function to a list
feature_select <- function(x) {
  lapply(districts, read.ts, feature = x) %>%
    set_names(districts)
}

```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# Implement the feature_select  function
all_data <- lapply(features, feature_select) %>% set_names(features)
Tmin <- all_data$Tmin
Tmean <- all_data$Tmean
Tmax <- all_data$Tmax
```

# 2. Minimum and Maximum evaluation

Two functions were developed to identify the district and date (year and
month) of the highest and the lowest max, min and mean temperature. All
our time series data are stored in three groups of temperature
parameter, which is a nested list a function was created and we employed
the lapply function to apply this function across the respective lists
within each group of parameters. The output of the implementation of
this function shows that for the average monthly minimum temperature;

-   The region with the highest temperature is England_SE_and_Central_S
    , and the date is Aug , 1997
-   The region with the lowest temperature is Scotland_E , and the date
    is Jan , 1895"

The region with the lowest and highest temperature measurement for the
average monthly maximum temperature is;

-   The region with the highest temperature is East_Anglia , and the
    date is Jul , 2006
-   The region with the lowest temperature is Midlands , and the date is
    Feb , 1947

Finally, the region with the lowest and highest temperature measurement
for the average monthly mean temperature is;

-   The region with the highest temperature is East_Anglia , and the
    date is Jul , 2006
-   The region with the lowest temperature is Scotland_E , and the date
    is Jan , 1895

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# Function to return the maximum value in nested list
max_eval <- function(x) {
  names(x)[which.max(unlist(lapply(x, FUN = max)))] -> region
  month.abb[(time(x[[region]])[which.max(x[[region]])] %% 1) * 12 + 1] -> month
  floor(time(x[[region]])[which.max(x[[region]])]) -> year
  paste(
    "The region with the highest temperature for",
    deparse(substitute(x)),
    "is",
    region,
    ",",
    "and the date is",
    month,
    ",",
    year
  )
}
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# Function to return the minimum value in nested list
min_eval <- function(x) {
  names(x)[which.min(unlist(lapply(x, FUN = min)))] -> region
  month.abb[(time(x[[region]])[which.min(x[[region]])] %% 1) * 12 + 1] -> month
  floor(time(x[[region]])[which.min(x[[region]])]) -> year
  paste(
    "The region with the lowest temperature for",
    deparse(substitute(x)),
    "is",
    region,
    ",",
    "and the date is",
    month,
    ",",
    year
  )
}
```

```{r, echo = FALSE,include=FALSE}
# Call min-max evaluating function
max_eval(Tmin)
min_eval(Tmin)
max_eval(Tmax)
min_eval(Tmax)
max_eval(Tmean)
min_eval(Tmean)
```

# 3 -- Exploratory Data Analysis

We performed some exploratory analysis on the time series data and
explores some questions about the time series data as seen below.

### Which district is the coldest/warmest?

We will be estimating the coldest and warmest region using the following
criteria. We have the time series data for the mean daily maximum air
temperature, the mean daily minimum and the mean of air for the regions.
We will find the coldest region by finding the region with the
highest/lowest temperature across these three groups of time series data
measured. We observed that the output using this criteria varies among
the three different groups of time seris. This can be seen in the output
below.

-   The region with the highest average monthly mean temperature is
    England_SE_and_Central_S , While the region with the lowest
    temperature is Scotland_N
-   The region with the highest average monthly minimum temperature is
    England_SW_and_S\_Wales, While the region with the lowest
    temperature is Scotland_E
-   The region with the highest average monthly maximum temperature is
    England_SE_and_Central_S, While the region with the lowest
    temperature is Scotland_N

```{r, echo = FALSE}
#creating a function to check average values for any time series parameter given
avg_temp <- function(x) {
  lapply(x, mean) -> tmp_val
  names(tmp_val)[which.max(unlist(lapply(tmp_val, FUN = max)))] -> warmest
  names(tmp_val)[which.min(unlist(lapply(tmp_val, FUN = min)))] -> coldest
  result <-
    paste(
      "The region with the highest temperature average for",
      deparse(substitute(x)),
      "is",
      warmest,
      ", While the region with the lowest temperature is",
      coldest
    )
  return(result)
}

```

```{r, echo = FALSE,include=FALSE}
avg_temp(Tmean)
avg_temp(Tmin)
avg_temp(Tmax)
```

### Which district has the widest temperature range?

We created a function that takes returns the highest range for a list of
time series data. This was applied to three groups of time series data
and we observed that for average monthly mean temperature and average
monthly minimum temperature East_Anglia and England_SE_and_Central_S had
the widest range but for the average monthly maximum temperature we
observed that East Anglia had the widest range of temperatures.

```{r, echo = FALSE,include=FALSE}
widest_range <- function(takes_list) {
  lapply(takes_list, min) %>% as.data.frame() - lapply(takes_list, max) %>% as.data.frame() -> range_diff
  range_diff[which(range_diff %in% apply(range_diff, 1, min))] -> widest_range
  return(widest_range)
}
```

```{r, echo = FALSE,include=FALSE}
widest_range(Tmean)
widest_range(Tmin)
widest_range(Tmax)
```

### Are winters/summers getting colder/hotter?

We employed data wrangling techniques to group our time series data into
two different seasons (winter and summer). We created a function to
convert all time series object to data frame of each season(winter and
summer). Each row in the dataframe represents a year and the months for
a specific season. This function was applied to the average monthly mean
temperature, this gives a summary of the occurence for each months in a
particular season. A function was then developed to merge all the
seasonal dataframe from each region into a single group for a specific
season and this was converted to a time series object using the function
ts(). The new time series data was then visualized on a time series plot
and we observed that the mean temperature for winter months has an
upward trend while that of summer months has a downward trend, this
means winters are getting hotter while summers are getting colder.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
winter <- c("Dec", "Jan", "Feb", "Year")
summer <- c("Jun", "Jul", "Aug", "Year")

get_season <- function(Tparameter, seas_param) {
  #convert to dataframe
  dmn <- list(month.abb, unique(floor(time(Tparameter))))
  as.data.frame(t(matrix(Tparameter , 12, dimnames = dmn))) -> ts_df
  #add year to dataframe
  ts_df$Year <- seq(1884, 2020)
  #subset data into seasons
  season <- seas_param
  #add to new variable
  ts_df[season] -> season
  return(season)
}
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
lapply(Tmean, get_season,seas_param=summer)->sum_mons
lapply(Tmean, get_season,seas_param=winter)->win_mons
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
merge_avg_all <- function(season_mons) {
  my_merge <- function(df1, df2) {
    merge(df1, df2, by = 'Year')
  }
  
  #merge all dataframe inside Parameter list to one
  Reduce(my_merge, season_mons) -> regions_tmp_seas
  
  
  #getting yearly average for all regions
  regions_tmp_seas$testMean <- rowMeans(regions_tmp_seas[, -1])
  
  
  #selecting year and average of all regions
  regions_mean <- regions_tmp_seas[c('Year', 'testMean')]
  
  
  #convert back to TS
  regions_mean  %>% subset(select = 2) %>% t() %>% as.vector() %>% ts(frequency = 1, end = c(2020, 1)) -> final_Temp
  
  return(final_Temp)
  
  
}

```

```{r,warning=FALSE, echo = FALSE}
plot(merge_avg_all(win_mons),main="Average Winter Temperature Trend",xlab="Year",ylab="Mean Temperature")
plot(merge_avg_all(sum_mons),main="Average Summer Temperature Trend",xlab="Year",ylab="Mean Temperature")
```

### 4 -- Trend and Seasonality Estimation

We created a function to subset the time series data For each district,
and considering the 3 time series: max temp, min temp and mean temp,
from 1884 until December 2019. This was implemented using the ts()
function which takes start of the series, frequency of the series, and
end of the series. We created a function that subsets our time series
from 1884 - 2019 called "subset_2019" which was then applied to the
entire 30 time series data set. The Lapply function is one used to apply
a function to every element in a list, since our 3 groups of time series
are stored as a nested list the lapply function was used to apply our
subset_2019 function on the 3 different groups of our time series data
Tmin, Tmax, Tmean to subset the 30 time series data from 1884-2019. We
manually created a time vector for our time series "time.all" which will
be used extensively in this analysis.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
#function to Subset each of the 30 time series until December 2019
subset_2019 <- function(x) {
  x %>% head(-12)
}
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
#subset all groups of time series data to december 2019 using subset_2019 function
lapply(Tmin, subset_2019) -> Tmin_2019
lapply(Tmean, subset_2019) -> Tmean_2019
lapply(Tmax, subset_2019) -> Tmax_2019
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# manually create time range
time.all <- seq(
  from = start(Tmax_2019$Northern_Ireland)[1],
  by = 1 / frequency(Tmax_2019$Northern_Ireland),
  length.out = length(Tmax_2019$Northern_Ireland)
)
```

Compare your results and use appropriate plots and/or tables to confirm
your observations.

### 4.1 Estimating trend

We estimated the trend of each time series using linear, quadratic and
cubic regression. A function was developed to apply the 3 different
order of polynomial models(linear, quadratic and cubic). The function
"run_model" takes a time series data and its time vector and returns its
linear, quadratic and cubic models. A function "plot_model" was created
which returns a plot of the time series data, linear, quadratic and
cubic models all together on a single plot. Finally, We created a
function "model_design" which returns the Akaike criterion (AIC) for
each model that was passed into its arguments.We are working with data
nested into a list and as such we will create a function that can apply
the model_design function to a list of time series, this new function
was called "apply_model_design". This function "apply_model_design" will
return a list of AIC values for the linear, quadratic and cubic models.
We then used the apply_model_design on the three groups of time series
data we have. The application of this function gives us the AIC value of
each region for the different parameters(TMIN,TMEAN and TMAX).

```{r, echo = FALSE}
#Function to return models
run_model <- function(data, time) {
  l_model <- lm(data ~ poly(time, degree = 1, raw = TRUE))
  q_model <- lm(data ~ poly(time, degree = 2, raw = TRUE))
  c_model <- lm(data ~ poly(time, degree = 3, raw = TRUE))
  
  return(list(
    l_model = l_model,
    q_model = q_model,
    c_model = c_model
  ))
}
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
#Function to return a plot
plot_model <- function(data, time,main) {
  l_var_name <- lm(data ~ poly(time, degree = 1, raw = TRUE))
  q_var_name <- lm(data ~ poly(time, degree = 2, raw = TRUE))
  c_var_name <- lm(data ~ poly(time, degree = 3, raw = TRUE))
  
  
  xlab <- "Year"
  ylab <- "Temperature"
  
  
  

  plot(
    data,
    main = main,
    ylab = ylab,
    xlab = xlab,
    xlim = c(1880, 2025),
    lwd = 1,
    type = "l"
  )
  lines(
    time,
    fitted(l_var_name),
    lwd = 5,
    col = 'red',
    lty = "dotdash"
  )
  lines(
    time,
    fitted(q_var_name),
    lwd = 5,
    col = 'green',
    lty = "dotdash"
  )
  lines(
    time,
    fitted(c_var_name),
    lwd = 5,
    col = 'yellow',
    lty = "dotdash"
  )
}
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
#Function to return a list of AIC of different models used for each group of time series
model_design <- function(data, time, var_name, poly_degree) {
  var_name <- lm(data ~ poly(time, degree = poly_degree, raw = TRUE))
  Var_AIC <- AIC(var_name)
  
  main <- "Average Temperature from 1879"
  xlab <- "Year"
  ylab <- "Temp"
  
  
  
  
  
  return(list(Var_AIC = Var_AIC))
}
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
#Function that applies the model_design function to a list and returns list of list
apply_model_design <- function(my_list) {
  lapply(
    my_list,
    model_design,
    var_name = 'linear',
    poly_degree = 1,
    time = time.all
  ) -> linear.models
  lapply(
    my_list,
    model_design,
    var_name = 'quadratic',
    poly_degree = 2,
    time = time.all
  )  -> quadratic.models
  lapply(
    my_list,
    model_design,
    var_name = 'cubic',
    poly_degree = 3,
    time = time.all
  ) -> cubic.models
  
  all_list <-
    list(
      linear.models = linear.models,
      quadratic.models = quadratic.models,
      cubic.models = cubic.models
    )
  
  return(all_list)
  
}

```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
#apply the apply_model_design function on different groups of Time series
apply_model_design(Tmin_2019)-> Tmin_models
apply_model_design(Tmax_2019)-> Tmax_models
apply_model_design(Tmean_2019)-> Tmean_models
```

Select a trend model for each time series using an appropriate criteria.
Are the models selected all the same? If not is there a pattern
depending on the region and/or the group (max, min and mean)?

### 4.2 Trend Selection

We created a function "which_model" which helps select the best model
for a time series, we have the linear, quadratic and cubic AIC values
for each region, we will use this function to find the model with the
least Akaike criterion(AIC) values which signifies the best model for
the time series data. The which_model() function when applied to a list
of different time series data returns a dataframe which has a column
"Best.Model" which shows the row-wise minimum for each region since each
row represents a region and its linear, quadratic and cubic models for a
specific parameter. It was observed that all the regions had their best
model as the linear model except for two regions(England_E\_and_NE and
East_Anglia) in the average monthly maximum temperature (Tmax)
parameter. The table for best models for each region for a specific
parameter can be found below.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# Function to return the best model
which_model <- function(Model_parameter) {
  Model_parameter$linear.models %>% as.data.frame() -> l
  names(l) <- c(names(Model_parameter$linear.models))
  
  Model_parameter$quadratic.models %>% as.data.frame() -> q
  names(q) <- c(names(Model_parameter$quadratic.models))
  
  Model_parameter$cubic.models %>% as.data.frame() -> c
  names(c) <- c(names(Model_parameter$cubic.models))
  
  ModelAIC <- c("Linear", "Quadratic", "Cubic")
  
  cbind(ModelAIC, rbind(l, q, c)) -> tminbind
  
  tminbind %>% as.vector() %>% t() %>% as.data.frame() -> new
  
  names(new) <- as.matrix(new[1,])
  new <- new[-1,]
  new[] <- lapply(new, function(x)
    type.convert(as.character(x)))
  
  new$Best.Model <- colnames(new)[apply(new, 1, FUN = which.min)]
  return(new)
}
```

###### Best Model by region for Average monthly minimum temperature

```{r, echo = FALSE}
which_model(Tmin_models) 
```

###### Best Model by region for Average monthly mean temperature

```{r, echo = FALSE}
which_model(Tmean_models)
```

###### Best Model by region for Average monthly maximum temperature

```{r, echo = FALSE}
which_model(Tmax_models)
```

As stated above we observed that all our model choice for all regions
are uniform except England_E\_and_NE and East_Anglia for the Tmax
parameter, it would be interesting to see a plot of the linear model vs
plot of the cubic model. We used the function "plot_model" created above
to implement these plots and we observe that there is a difference in
the plots for the different regions, while Northern Ireland has a more
stable trend, we can see that England_E\_and_NE and East_Anglia do have
some cubic trend.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
plot_model(Tmax_2019$England_E_and_NE,time.all,"Trend of Average monthly maximum temperature England_E_and_NE")
```
![trend](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Muizzkolapo/blog/main/content/docs/trend.png)

```{r, echo = FALSE}
plot_model(Tmax_2019$East_Anglia,time.all,"Trend of Average monthly maximum temperature East_Anglia")
```
![trend1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Muizzkolapo/blog/main/content/docs/trend1.png)

```{r, echo = FALSE}
plot_model(Tmax_2019$Northern_Ireland,time.all,"Trend of Average monthly maximum temperature Northern_Ireland")
```
![trend2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Muizzkolapo/blog/main/content/docs/trend3.png)

### 4.3 Estimating seasonality using seasonal means and harmonic models

###### 4.3.1 removing Trend using averaging

We will create a function that removes the trend component and returns
its monthly average. The function takes two arguments which are the time
series data and the polynomial model that bests fit it according to the
Akaike Criterion. All models except England_E\_and_NE and East_Anglia
for the Tmax parameter have a linear model as their best model. We will
split the Tmax time series data into two groups the linear and the cubic
groups, this would make it easier to apply functions which are specific
to the best model for each region. We will then use the return_month_avg
to return the seasonal means of each of the different regions based on
their best trend model.

```{r, echo = FALSE}

return_month_avg <- function(takes_data, model_type) {
  run_model(takes_data, time.all) -> model.result
  
  data.notrend <- takes_data - fitted(model.result[[model_type]])
  
  tapply(data.notrend, cycle(takes_data), mean)  %>% as.data.frame() -> fin_month_avg
  colnames(fin_month_avg) <- c('Season_Mean')
  mymonths <- c("Jan",
                "Feb",
                "Mar",
                "Apr",
                "May",
                "Jun",
                "Jul",
                "Aug",
                "Sep",
                "Oct",
                "Nov",
                "Dec")
  #add abbreviated month name
  fin_month_avg$Month <- mymonths
  return(fin_month_avg)
  
  
}
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# Subsetting cubic and linear model for TMAX
Tmax_2019[-c(5,8)] -> Tmax_2019_ln

Tmax_2019[c(5,8)]-> Tmax_2019_cubic
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
#----Estimate seasonal average for All linear model
lapply(Tmin_2019, return_month_avg, model_type = "l_model") %>% set_names(names(Tmin_2019)) -> Tmin_monthly_avg
lapply(Tmean_2019, return_month_avg, model_type = "l_model") %>% set_names(names(Tmin_2019)) -> Tmean_monthly_avg
lapply(Tmax_2019_ln, return_month_avg, model_type = "l_model") %>% set_names(names(Tmax_2019_ln)) -> Tmax_monthly_avg_ln

#----Estimate seasonal average for All cubic model
lapply(Tmax_2019_cubic, return_month_avg, model_type = "c_model") %>% set_names(names(Tmax_2019_cubic)) -> Tmean_monthly_avg_cubic
```

###### Sample monthly average for Northern Ireland

```{r, echo = FALSE}
Tmin_monthly_avg$Northern_Ireland
```
![seasmean](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Muizzkolapo/blog/main/content/docs/seasmean.png)

###### 4.3.2 Estimate seasonality with seasonal average

The seasonality was estimated using the seasonal means method. We
created a function return_seas_avg which takes the time series data and
model type. The function models the inputs and returns the seasonal
means for each of the time series provided to it. We used lapply to
apply the return_seas_avg to the list of time series for the different
parameters Tmin, Tmax, Tmean.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
return_seas_avg <- function(data, model_type) {
  #one region since all months are the same
  months <- as.factor(cycle(Tmin_2019$Northern_Ireland))
  # Apply the run_model function to the data to get the specified model
  run_model(data, time.all) -> model.result
  # Get the residuals from the data which does not have the trend
  data.notrend <- data - fitted(model.result[[model_type]])
  seas.means <- lm(data.notrend ~ months - 1)
  
  
  
  return(seas.means)
}
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}

#### 4.3.2 Estimating seasonality using harmonic mean

We created a function to give the harmonic mean of a time series data.
We performed a trend check on the time series and remove the specified
trend type(l_model,c_model and q_model). The residuals were derived by
subtracting the data from the fitted data. In our dataset since all our
best models are linear except for England_E\_and_NE and East_Anglia for
the average monthly maximum temperature, this means all our models will
be linear except these two which will be cubic. In this step we applied
the return_harmonic function to all our time series data, a check will
be done for models that are significant at a p-value of 0.05.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# Function to return the harmonic mean of a time series data
return_harmonic <- function(takes_data, trend_type) {
  # Apply the run_model function to the data to get the specified model
  run_model(takes_data, time.all) -> model.result
  
  # Get the residuals from the data which does not have the trend
  data.notrend <- takes_data - fitted(model.result[[trend_type]])
  
  # Create a matrix of SINE and COSINE values
  SIN <- COS <- matrix(nrow = length(time.all), ncol = 6)
  for (i in 1:6) {
    SIN[, i] <- sin(2 * pi * i * time.all)
    COS[, i] <- cos(2 * pi * i * time.all)
  }
  
  # Function to return harmonic of specified order
  seasonal.har <- function(order) {
    assign(paste(c("seasonal.har", order), collapse = ""),
           lm(data.notrend ~ . - 1,
              data.frame(SIN = SIN[, 1:order], COS = COS[, 1:order])))
    
    
    return(get(paste(c(
      "seasonal.har", order
    ), collapse = "")))
    
  }
  
  
  
  # order 1
  seas.har1 <- seasonal.har(1)
  
  # order 2
  seas.har2 <- seasonal.har(2)
  
  # order 3
  seas.har3 <- seasonal.har(3) # SIN.3 not significant
  
  # order 4
  seas.har4 <- seasonal.har(4) # SIN.3 COS.4 not significant
  
  
  # order 5
  seas.har5 <-
    seasonal.har(5) # SIN.3 SIN5 COS.4 COS.5 not significant
  
  
  
  # order 6
  seas.har6 <-
    seasonal.har(6) # SIN.3 SIN5 SIN.6 COS.4 COS.5 COS.6 not significant
  
  
  return(
    list(
      seas.har1 = seas.har1,
      seas.har2 = seas.har2,
      seas.har3 = seas.har3,
      seas.har4 = seas.har4,
      seas.har5 = seas.har5,
      seas.har6 = seas.har6
    )
  )
}
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# Apply the return_harmonic function to all time series
lapply(Tmin_2019, return_harmonic, trend_type = "l_model") %>% set_names(names(Tmin_2019)) -> Tmin_harmonic
lapply(Tmean_2019, return_harmonic, trend_type = "l_model") %>% set_names(names(Tmean_2019)) -> Tmean_harmonic
lapply(Tmax_2019_ln, return_harmonic, trend_type = "l_model") %>% set_names(names(Tmax_2019_ln)) -> Tmax_harmonic_ln
#remove the cubic trend from England_E_and_NE and East_Anglia for the Tmax parameter
lapply(Tmax_2019_cubic, return_harmonic, trend_type = "c_model") %>% set_names(names(Tmax_2019_cubic)) -> Tmax_harmonic_cubic
```

##### significant models

We created a function to return the significant models for a specific
region and harmonic. We need models with a p-value lower than that of
the null hypothesis. We create region_harmonics() function to take a
list and apply all the function singular_harmonic using lapply() to all
the elements in the list provided in the argument. We developed a
function grouped_harmonica() that applies the region_harmonics function
to a nested list. This would return only the models that has passed the
null hypothesis test, hence containing only significant models.

The Null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis are as follows:

-   Null hypothesis: The model is not significant
-   Alternative hypothesis: The model is significant

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# p-value lesser than 0.05 shows significant that null is false
singular_harmonic <- function(x) {
  summary(x) -> temp
  temp$coefficients %>% as.data.frame() -> temp2
  temp2 <- temp2[temp2$`Pr(>|t|)` < 0.05,]
  temp2$Harmonic.Model <- row.names(temp2)
  #return(temp2)
  
  
}

```

```{r, echo = FALSE}


region_harmonics <- function(takes_list) {
  lapply(takes_list, singular_harmonic) %>%  set_names(names(takes_list)) -> significant_mods
  return(significant_mods)
}

```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
grouped_harmonica <- function(x) {
  lapply(x, region_harmonics) %>% set_names(names(x)) -> Tmin_best_harmonics
  return(Tmin_best_harmonics)
}

grouped_harmonica(Tmin_harmonic) -> Tmin_indexed_harmonics
grouped_harmonica(Tmean_harmonic) -> Tmean_indexed_harmonics
grouped_harmonica(Tmax_harmonic_ln) -> Tmax.ln_indexed_harmonics
grouped_harmonica(Tmax_harmonic_cubic) -> Tmax.cub_indexed_harmonics
```

#### Unique models across all time series

We created a function that checks the unique models for each element in
a list. This unique model would be used to then recreate the harmonic
models. We retrieved the best harmonic for each region i.e all harmonics
with P-value lesser than the null hypothesis p-value of 0.05. We applied
the unique function to all our best model to retrieve only unique
models. We observed 5 different unique configurations for our models,
this would be used to create 5 different functions, each function will
be specific to the unique model configurations found in the
implementation below.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
best_harm <- function(takes_list) {
  lapply(takes_list, unique) %>% set_names(names(takes_list)) -> significant_harmonics
  return(significant_harmonics)
}
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
Tmin_best_harmonics <- best_harm(Tmin_indexed_harmonics)
Tmean_best_harmonics <- best_harm(Tmean_indexed_harmonics)
Tmax.ln_best_harmonics <- best_harm(Tmax.ln_indexed_harmonics)
Tmax.cub_best_harmonics <- best_harm(Tmax.cub_indexed_harmonics)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
#unique(Tmin_best_harmonics)
best_model_list <-
  c(
    Tmin_best_harmonics,
    Tmean_best_harmonics,
    Tmax.ln_best_harmonics,
    Tmax.cub_best_harmonics
  )
lapply(best_model_list, unique) %>%  set_names(names(best_model_list)) -> all_unique_best
```

```{r, echo = FALSE,include=FALSE}
length(unique(all_unique_best) )
```

```{r, echo = FALSE,include=FALSE}
# View unique model config
unique(all_unique_best)
```

###### create functions to map models

Five different functions were developed inline with the 5 different
significant harmonic models we had during the null hypothesis test. The
functions are:

-   rerun_harmonic1 - ["SIN" "COS" ] and ["SIN.1" "SIN.2" "COS.1"
    "COS.2"]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   rerun_harmonic2 - ["SIN" "COS"], ["SIN.1" "SIN.2" "COS.1" "COS.2"]
    and ["SIN.1" "SIN.2" "COS.1" "COS.2" "COS.4"]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   rerun_harmonic3 - ["SIN" "COS"], ["SIN.1" "SIN.2" "COS.1" "COS.2"]
    and ["SIN.1" "SIN.2" "SIN.5" "COS.1" "COS.2"]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   rerun_harmonic4 - ["SIN" "COS"], ["SIN.1" "SIN.2" "COS.1" "COS.2"]
    and ["SIN.1" "SIN.2" "COS.1" "COS.2" "COS.3"]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   rerun_harmonic5 - ["SIN" "COS"], ["SIN.1" "SIN.2" "COS.1" "COS.2"],
    ["SIN.1" "SIN.2" "COS.1" "COS.2" "COS.3"] and ["SIN.1" "SIN.2"
    "SIN.4" "COS.1" "COS.2" "COS.3"]

We observe that all significant models include the first and second
harmonics with little variations among the other models. The functions
takes the time series data and the best trend model for it l_model,
q_model or c_model and returns the harmonic with the lowest Akaike
criterion among all the harmonic models implemented within the specific
function. Implementing this function gives us the best harmonic model
for each of the 30 time series data we are working with.

##### Subset all the time series into groups of significant harmonic model

We have 5 different configurations of significant harmonnic models, we
will group each of our time series parameter (Tmin,Tmean and Tmax) to
the significant harmonic model group they belong to among these 5
configurations after which their respective function is then applied on
each subset. Based on initial analysis we observed that for our average
monthly maximum temperature we have two regions with a cubic trend model
as their best trend model, we will create a different subset for this
group to make the implementation of these functions on the time series
data seamless.

# 4.4 Seasonal model selection Seasonal average or harmonic models?

• Select a seasonal model for each time series using an appropriate
criteria. Are the models selected all the same? If not is there a
pattern depending on the region and/or the group (max, min and mean)? We
now have the different significant harmonic models and the seasonal
means of all our time series, we will use the Akaike Criterion to
determine the best model for each time series data, as stated above the
model with the least AIC will be the best model for the specific time
series data.

##### create a function that selects best model for all different parameters

We created a function get_min_AIC that takes 3 arguments the
district/region, the best harmonic model, and the seasonal average and
returns the model with the lowest Akaike criterion. In this function we
combine the AIC of the seasonal average model of the time series and the
AIC of the harmonic model and then return the model with the lowest AIC.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
get_min_AIC <- function(x, y, z) {
  AIC(z[[x]]) -> seas.avg
  y [[x]]  -> temp1
  temp1 <- c(temp1, seas.avg = seas.avg)
  
  names(temp1)[which.min(unlist(lapply(temp1, FUN = min)))] -> res
  
  
  return(res)
}

```

##### All TMIN

We used the do.call function to re-combine our different configurations
for TMIN parameter into one list for each parameter. The get_min_AIC
method was then applied on each time series to return the model with the
lowest AIC and we observe that seasonal average was not the best for any
of the time series in this group.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
do.call(c,
        list(
          significant_Tmin_dual,
          significant_Tmin_trio1,
          significant_Tmin_trio2
        )) -> Tmin_harm_final
lapply(districts, get_min_AIC, y = Tmin_harm_final, z = Tmin_seas_est) %>% set_names(districts) -> best_model_TMIN
best_model_TMIN %>% as.data.frame() %>%  t() %>%  as.data.frame() ->Tmin.best
names(Tmin.best)[1] <- "Best Model Tmin"
Tmin.best
```

for TMEAN parameter into one list for each parameter. The get_min_AIC
method was then applied on each time series to return the model with the
lowest AIC and we observe that seasonal average was not the best for any
of the time series in this group.

##### ALL Tmax

We combined the time series with a linear trend into a single list and
applied the get_min_AIC and the same was done for time series with a
cubic trend.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
do.call(
  c,
  list(
    significant_Tmax.ln_dual,
    significant_Tmax.ln_trio1,
    significant_Tmax.ln_trio2
  )
) -> Tmax_harm_final_ln

significant_Tmax.cub_trio2 -> Tmax_harm_final_cubic

linear_districts <- names(Tmax_2019)[-c(5, 8)]
lapply(linear_districts, get_min_AIC, y = Tmax_harm_final_ln, z = Tmax_seas_est_ln) %>% set_names(linear_districts) -> best_model_TMax_ln
best_model_TMax_ln %>% as.data.frame() %>%  t() %>% as.data.frame() -> Tmax.ln.best
names(Tmax.ln.best)[1] <- "Best Models Tmax"

cubic_district <- names(Tmax_2019)[c(5, 8)]
lapply(cubic_district, get_min_AIC, y = Tmax_harm_final_cubic, z = Tmax_seas_est_cubic) %>% set_names(cubic_district) -> best_model_TMax_cubic
best_model_TMax_cubic %>% as.data.frame() %>%  t() %>% as.data.frame() -> Tmax.cb.best
names(Tmax.cb.best)[1] <- "Best Models Tmax"

rbind.data.frame(Tmax.ln.best,Tmax.cb.best)

```
![tmax](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Muizzkolapo/blog/main/content/docs/tmax.png)

We used the unique function to check the unique best models for each
group of our time series and we can see we have 5 different best models
distributed among the different time series data. Similar to the
approach used above, we will create 5 functions that models our combined
trend model and seasonal models for each time series data. **Unique
Models**

```{r, echo = FALSE}
list(
  unique(best_model_TMIN),
  unique(best_model_TMean),
  unique(best_model_TMax_ln),
  unique(best_model_TMax_cubic)
) %>%  unlist() %>% unique()
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
list(
  unique(best_model_TMIN),
  unique(best_model_TMean),
  unique(best_model_TMax_ln),
  unique(best_model_TMax_cubic)
) %>%  unlist() %>% unique() %>%  length()
```

# 4.5 Building combined model for trend and seasonality

We have 5 different best model distributed among the different groups of
time series, we will create 5 functions to implement the combine models
based on the groups each time series data belongs to, we will subset the
time series into their respective groups and apply these functions
across the respective groups. Finally, We combined all the different
models for the time series into a variable called "final".

A function return_quad_sin_cos was created to Estimate trend and

models. We created a function to apply the return_quad_sin_cos on a
nested list called def_temp. The final outputs were joined into a list

# 5 ARMA and Forecasting

### 5.1 Retrieving the residuals for test and final models

We subsetted the final and test model into subsets of the component
parameters (Tmax,Tmean and Tmin), a function was created to derive the
residuals for both final and test models. The mapply function was used
to dervive the residuals by subtracting the combined model(final and
test) from the original time series data. We removed trend and
seasonality from each of the 30 time series for both the final and test
model and hence we now have 60 residuals time series.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
final$Tmin_final_model -> Tmin_final_model
final$Tmean_final_model -> Tmean_final_model
final$Tmax_final_model -> Tmax_final_model
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
test$Tmin_2019 -> Tmin_test_model
test$Tmean_2019 -> Tmean_test_model
test$Tmax_2019 -> Tmax_test_model
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
residuals_func <- function(ts_data,final_model){
residuals <- ts_data - final_model %>% fitted()
return(residuals)
}
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
#to apply mapply create a variable sorted names
sorted_district <- sort(names(Tmin_2019))
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
#we had to sort cause mapply works only on sorted

mapply(residuals_func, Tmean_2019[sorted_district], Tmean_final_model[sorted_district], SIMPLIFY = FALSE) -> residual_tmean
mapply(residuals_func, Tmax_2019[sorted_district], Tmax_final_model[sorted_district], SIMPLIFY = FALSE) -> residual_tmax

mapply(residuals_func, Tmean_2019[sorted_district], Tmean_test_model[sorted_district], SIMPLIFY = FALSE) -> test_residual_tmean
mapply(residuals_func, Tmax_2019[sorted_district], Tmax_test_model[sorted_district], SIMPLIFY = FALSE) -> test_residual_tmax
```

### 5.2 Fit the residuals with an appropriate ARMA model.

To fit a arma model to all our time series we created a function
"fit_fun" which takes a residual as an argument and returns a model for
our residuals. This was used to create forecasts for our time series
later in this study. The lapply function was used to apply the fit_func
function across our nested time series in both final and test set. We
assigned the outcome into 6 different lists which reperesents Tmax,
Tmean and Tmin for final and test model.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
fit_func <- function(residuals) {
  ## Order selection -- AIC
  n <- length(residuals)
  norder <- 4
  
  p <- c(1:norder) - 1
  q <- c(1:norder) - 1
  
  aic <- matrix(0, norder, norder)
  
  for (i in 1:norder) {
    for (j in 1:norder) {
      modij <- arima(residuals,
                     order = c(p[i], 0, q[j]),
                     method = 'ML')
      
      aic[i, j] <-
        modij$aic - 2 * (p[i] + q[j] + 1) + 2 * (p[i] + q[j] + 1) * n / (n - p[i] -
                                                                           q[j] - 2)
    }
  }
  
  #aicv <- as.vector(aic)
  
  #plot(aicv, ylab="AIC values")
  
  indexaic <- which(aic == min(aic), arr.ind = TRUE)
  
  porder <- indexaic[1, 1] - 1
  qorder <- indexaic[1, 2] - 1
  # Final residuals model
  residuals.model <-
    arima(residuals,
          order = c(porder, 0, qorder),
          method = "ML")
  return(residuals.model)
}
```

```{r, warning=FALSE, echo = FALSE}
lapply(residual_tmin, fit_func) %>% set_names(names(residual_tmin)) -> Tmin_residual_models
lapply(residual_tmean, fit_func) %>% set_names(names(residual_tmean)) -> Tmean_residual_models

```

### 5.3 Forecasting

We will Forecast the average max, min and mean temperature for each
month of 2020. We have to forecast the trend, seasonal components and
rthe residuals which would then be combined to give our actual
forecasts. Earlier in this analysis we observed that our best model for
harmonics were splitted into 5 different configurations, we will
implement similar solution here creating 5 different functions based on
the 5 configurations. The functions were applied to their respective
group of time series data and this gave us the final predictions for our
models.

### 5.4 Model Comparison

We will be evaluating the accuracy of our predictions using the accuracy
function of the forecast library, we used the subsetted time series of
2020 data for all our time series as the actual while outcome of our
predictions for 2020 as the predicted. We are going to observe our
models performance with unseen data not used when fitting the model. The
mapply function was used to apply the model_accuracy function across all
our different time series predictions for best test and final.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
model_accuracy <- function(y.pred, y.ts) {
  y.actual <- window(y.ts, start = 2020)
  accuracy(y.pred, y.actual)
}
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
mapply(model_accuracy, Tmin_final_predictions[sorted_district], Tmin[sorted_district], SIMPLIFY = FALSE) -> Tmin_accuracy
mapply(model_accuracy, Tmean_final_predictions[sorted_district], Tmean[sorted_district], SIMPLIFY = FALSE) -> Tmean_accuracy
mapply(model_accuracy, Tmax_final_predictions[sorted_district], Tmax[sorted_district], SIMPLIFY = FALSE) -> Tmax_accuracy
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
mapply(model_accuracy, Tmin_test_pred[sorted_district], Tmin[sorted_district], SIMPLIFY = FALSE) -> Tmin_accuracy_test
mapply(model_accuracy, Tmean_test_pred[sorted_district], Tmean[sorted_district], SIMPLIFY = FALSE) -> Tmean_accuracy_test
mapply(model_accuracy, Tmax_test_pred[sorted_district], Tmax[sorted_district], SIMPLIFY = FALSE) -> Tmax_accuracy_test
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
get_rmse<-function(x,y){
  y[[x]][2]-> a
  
  return(a)
}
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
#function to get rmse of all time series 
get_all_rmse <- function(Tmin,Tmean,Tmax){
  
  lapply(names(Tmin), get_rmse,y=Tmin) %>%  set_names(names(Tmin)) %>% as.data.frame() %>% t() %>% as.data.frame() %>% set_names("Tmin_rmse") -> Tmin_rmse
lapply(names(Tmean), get_rmse,y=Tmean) %>%  set_names(names(Tmean)) %>% as.data.frame() %>% t() %>% as.data.frame() %>% set_names("Tmean_rmse") -> Tmean_rmse
lapply(names(Tmax), get_rmse,y=Tmax) %>%  set_names(names(Tmax)) %>% as.data.frame() %>% t() %>% as.data.frame() %>% set_names("Tmax_rmse") -> Tmax_rmse

return(cbind(Tmin_rmse,Tmean_rmse,Tmax_rmse))
  
}
```

We observe the rmse for our models below, we can see the rmse for both
the test model and final model, we observed that for some regions the
test model performed better than the final model according to the rmse
figures in the tables below.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
get_all_rmse(Tmin_accuracy,Tmean_accuracy,Tmax_accuracy) 
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
get_all_rmse(Tmin_accuracy_test,Tmean_accuracy_test,Tmax_accuracy_test)

We focused our analysis on the values from the test model predictions,
final model predictions and the actual predictions for the South wales
and North wales region, a plot was implemented and we observe that the
plots are similar for the three different variables for north and south
wales.
