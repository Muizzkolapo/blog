Abstract
===================================

The high impact of road transport on the environment calls for both scientific and social policies to
control carbon and greenhouse gas emissions. The goal of this research is to study cars and taxis as a top
contributor to CO2 emissions and reiterate the importance of putting policies in place to reduce car use.
The CO, CO2 and greenhouse gas emissions were assessed in relation to local, national and International
emissions. This study investigated the contribution of road transport to the overall Carbon emissions in
order to highlight the need for a different approach to reducing air pollution through individual and
communal responsibility.
